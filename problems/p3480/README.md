## Commentary
Did not solve. \
Learned the solution from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pyqSxF2C3o

I don't know how to come up with this solution but it was a very elegant 
way of visualizing the problem as a 2D matrix and counting the boxes.

1) Needed to be able to translate the 1D intervals as something like a 2D matrix.
2) From there you can figure out a way to count the number squares which are blocked
by the conflicting pairs.
3) Next you need to figure out a way to figure out which removed pair would
provide the best solution.

IDK. Fuck.
